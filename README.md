#Early Halo Model Code in C++
                                                                                           
When I had some free time, I was thinking about writing an open source halo model code in C++. The
benefit of this is that it could be checked and used by others -- and subsequently improved instead
of each group having proprietary code.

Also, this is **alpha** level. Currently this just calculates the matter transfer function using
C libraries from Wayne Hu (Eisenstein & Hu 1997) and times the calculation.

If you are interested in taking this further I wouldn't mind a coding partner to keep me motivated.
Since I'm out of grad school now, I'm not really digging this at the moment.
